Every day, more than five billion people generate some kind of data over the Internet. As a tool for accessing that information, we need to use search services, 
either in the form of Web Search Engines or through Personal Assistants. On each interaction with them, our record of actions via logs, is used to offer a more useful 
experience. For companies, logs are also very valuable since they offer a way to monetize the service. Monetization is achieved by selling data to third parties, 
however query logs could potentially expose sensitive user information: identifiers, sensitive data from users (such as diseases, sexual tendencies, religious beliefs) 
or be used for what is called ”life-logging”: a continuous record of one’s daily activities. Current regulations oblige companies to protect this personal information. 
Protection systems for closed data sets have previously been proposed, most of them working with atomic files or structured data. 
Unfortunately, those systems do not fit when used in the growing real-time unstructured data environment posed by Internet services. 
This thesis aims to design techniques to protect the user’s sensitive information in a non-structured real-time streaming environment, guaranteeing a trade-off 
between data utility and protection. In this regard, three proposals have been made in efficient log protection.
